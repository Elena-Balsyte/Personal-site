            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
             <div class="half-width">
               <p><strong><span style="color:darkred">Hello World! </span></strong>I am a self-starter Front-end developer. My journey into tech started when I moved to London as a single mum. I needed to find a way to work and take care of my child. So I decided that the best option for me was to work remotely. Being a person that loves learning new things, I knew that I would enjoy a job that allows me to work on projects that require the ability to learn fast and stay focused for a long time. So I dived into the digital world and I spent months browsing and reading about all the opportunities that the World Wide Web can bring for you.</p>
             </div>
             <div class="half-width">
               <p>I took some online courses and learned about the fundamentals of digital marketing, I practiced using Adobe Photoshop and created a few websites with WordPress and Elementor builder. Then it was time for HTML and CSS. I learned how to write semantic code and how to use the version control system Git. My journey of becoming a developer continues and I am excited and motivated to study and practice every day. I am open to opportunities in the tech world and I am motivated to become a part of a team that develops this amazing Digital World.</p>

              <h3>Hand-coded HTML and well organized CSS</h3>
              <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible. I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

              <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
              <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is a pixel-perfect match. One of my goals this year is to improve my design skills and learn all that takes to create a beautiful piece of art which can be coded.</p>

              <h3>Creating websites with WordPress.</h3>
              <p>Need a website that is a quick solution and ready to edit whenever you need it? Choosing WordPress allows using hundreds of ready-made templates and plugins to create a website with beautiful design and great functionality.</p>

               <!--<h3><em>"Learning is the key to quality life"</em></h3>-->
               <p>I believe that constant learning gives you satisfaction in life as you can feel your progression every day. I am motivated to learn continuously and I believe that there is nothing that I wouldn't be able to learn.</p>
               <p>Therefore I am looking for opportunities that encourage improving development skills and grow knowledge. I am willing to focus on my career and give my full attention to the team that I would be working with.</p>
               <p>My next steps are fundamentals of design, coding responsive websites, JavaScript and working with Frameworks. </p>
